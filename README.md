## Overview
This project is a simple flashcard app built using SwiftUI. The app allows users to create, view, and manage a deck of flashcards. Users can swipe through the cards, toggle between the question and answer, and categorize cards for further practice. The project demonstrates the declarative nature of SwiftUI and explores core concepts like state management, gestures, and view modifiers. The app also supports saving data across sessions and enables users to delete flashcards.


## What I Learned
* SwiftUI’s Declarative Approach: Defined the UI by describing its desired state, allowing SwiftUI to manage updates automatically.
* Anatomy of a SwiftUI App: Replaced storyboards and view controllers with @main, App, and ContentView to structure the app.
* Live Previews: Utilized Xcode’s live preview feature for real-time feedback while developing the UI.
* Building Views: Used SwiftUI components like VStack, Image, and Text to construct the interface.
* View Modifiers: Applied view modifiers like .padding() and .foregroundStyle() to customize appearance and layout.

## Features
* Toggle between flashcard question and answer.
* Change card color when swiping left or right.
* Navigate through flashcards by swiping.
* Reset deck to include all cards or only those needing more practice.
* Create new flashcards and add them to the deck.
* Save flashcards across app launches.
* Delete flashcards from the deck.
