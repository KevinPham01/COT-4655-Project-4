## What I Learned
* SwiftUI’s Declarative Approach: Defined the UI by describing its desired state, allowing SwiftUI to manage updates automatically.
* Anatomy of a SwiftUI App: Replaced storyboards and view controllers with @main, App, and ContentView to structure the app.
* Live Previews: Utilized Xcode’s live preview feature for real-time feedback while developing the UI.
* Building Views: Used SwiftUI components like VStack, Image, and Text to construct the interface.
* View Modifiers: Applied view modifiers like .padding() and .foregroundStyle() to customize appearance and layout.

## Features
* Toggle between flashcard question and answer.
* Change card color when swiping left or right.
* Navigate through flashcards by swiping.
* Reset deck to include all cards or only those needing more practice.
* Create new flashcards and add them to the deck.
* Save flashcards across app launches.
* Delete flashcards from the deck.
